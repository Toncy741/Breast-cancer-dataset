This program implements and compares five machine learning classification algorithms on the breast cancer dataset:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

The dataset is preprocessed, including feature scaling. Each algorithm is trained on the data and evaluated using accuracy on a test set. Results show all models performing well, with accuracies between 94.74% and 97.37%. Logistic Regression and SVM tied for best performance (97.37%), while Decision Tree and k-NN tied for lowest (94.74%). The small performance gap (2.63%) suggests all algorithms are viable for this dataset, with linear models surprisingly effective.
